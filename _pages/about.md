I'm a Ph.D. student at the [DANTE](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/scse/dmal/dante/) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), fortunate supervised by [Prof. Sourav S Bhowmick](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/assourav/) and [Prof. Chen Shen-Hsing Annabel](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp01013). I received my B.Eng. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan University in 2022, where I was supervised by Prof. Liu Quanhui on computational epidemiology. I've always had a strong interest in interdisciplinary computing research, and my current research interests focus on the social psychology-informed design of social search and analytics techniques.
